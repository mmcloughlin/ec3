    abstract: Much current research focuses on fast evaluation of RSA, which consists
      of computing powers modulo a large number n. While some try to increase the
      speed of multiplica- tions, here we consider reducing the number of multiplications.
      In particular, we present a precomputation method that reduces the number of
      multiplications for the computation of a given power.
